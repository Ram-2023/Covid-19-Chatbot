## What is the purpose of creating this project?

In present covid situation so many are suffering with covid 19 virus.If suddenly they are infected with virus they didn't know in which hospital oxygen beds are available,what are the vaccination hospitals near to their place etc,.They need not fear at that time.Using this bot they can find out what are the best hospitals.So that's why we have to come with this project "Covid-19 Chatbot".

## How bot Works?

First of all user enters with greet like Hii,Hello or Namasthe.Then bot activates and give five choices(Menu page).User want to choose any one of the choice.If user chooses first or second choice,bot gives 13 districts.User want to choose required district.On selection of district bot provides information.Or else if user chooses another three choices bot provides information based on that choice.In between if user wants to go back to menu page type "Menu" or to quit from the bot type "Thank you".This is the way the bot works.
